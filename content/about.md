I am **Hardik Patel**. I work at the intersection of Finance and Computer Science. I recently started in sketching stick figures on my spare time. This is where most of my sketches/comics are hosted.

Sketches and comics on this website are heavily inspired by [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/). Other inspirations include:

* [PHD comics](http://phdcomics.com/)
* [The Oatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/comics)
